ledger2beancount
================

(set of) script(s) to automatically
convert [Ledger](https://www.ledger-cli.org/)-based textual ledgers
to [Beancount](http://furius.ca/beancount/) ones.

Conversion is based on (concrete) syntax, so that information that are not
meaningful for accounting reasons but still valuable (e.g., comments,
formatting, etc.) can be preserved.
